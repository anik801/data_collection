# data_collection
Hardware based data collection system built with Raspberry Pi, Python, PhP, MySQL, and, JavaScript. 

The system is designed in two folds. One is the distributed hardware modules centered by Raspberry Pi and the other is the server side. We have seperated the code accordingly. 

The project is at its early stage right now. So, there will be a lot of changes over the time.
